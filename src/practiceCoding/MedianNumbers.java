Median of sliding window in an array
Given an array of integer arr[] and an integer k, the task is to find the median of each window of size k
starting from the left and moving towards the right by one position each time.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = {-1, 5, 13, 8, 2, 3, 3, 1}, k=3;    // this is my array and k=3 is how many elements I will have in summary
Output: 5 8 8 3 3 3
Input: arr[] = {-1, 5, 13, 8, 2, 3, 3, 1}, k=4;
Output: 6.5 6.5 5.5 3.0 2.5
